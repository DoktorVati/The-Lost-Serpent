# The-Lost-Serpent
This game was created for the (GASTC) Georgia State Technology Competition.  This was one of my first major projects and releases that was fully fledged out.  This game includes sounds, music, cutscenes, animations, sprites, and scripts all developed by myself. This game can be downloaded for free at https://doktor-vati.itch.io/the-lost-serpent
